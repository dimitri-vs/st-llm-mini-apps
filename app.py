### Current Apps

- **Better Loom Info**: Enhances Loom video transcripts with AI-generated summaries and chapter markers.
- **New Upwork Contract**: Draft standardized contract titles and descriptions for new or existing Upwork contracts, with an eye toward SEO marketing value.
- **Claude Better Chat UI**: A work in progress chat UI using Streamlit's chat components to explore advanced conversation flows.

### Coming Soon

- **Client Onboarding** (Name TBD): Will help capture and generate the core content needed for initial client engagementsâ€”like summarizing transcripts, creating a client profile, and drafting a project plan.
  (We haven't created a "pages/client_onboarding.py" file yet, but we'll likely add it soon!)
