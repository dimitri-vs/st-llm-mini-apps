Your task is to draft a title and description for a new Upwork contract. I will provide you with what was discussed as requirements and scope so far and you can infer the future direction to help you craft an appropriate title and description for this new contract phase.

Additional Text Snippets

I will provide various snippets of text that may provide additional context about the client/project. They might be document excerpts, message exchanges, etc. Note that these snippets may not be directly relevant to the task at hand. Only reference them if pertinent.

<Additional Text Snippets>
{additional_context}
</Additional Text Snippets>

Response Guidelines

First, help me create a variety of three descriptive contract titles, each around 8 words. These titles should succinctly encapsulate the goal, scope and main platform/framework of the project as outlined above. The title should be in a concise, terms-focused, and abbreviation-heavy style with the use of industry-specific terms.

Then, write a description. The first half can a summary/overview of the project. The second half should also be in paragraph form and focus on the next steps, but subtly being open ended.

Lastly, list out any things that I might want to censor in this description for confidentiality or proprietary reasons. Prefix this section with an "‚ö†Ô∏è" emoji
