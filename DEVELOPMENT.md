# Development Notes & LLM Context

Project serves as a playground for LLM/VLM mini-apps using Python, Streamlit, and various AI providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google). Focus on prompt template experimentation and prototyping for agency use cases

Current mini-apps include:
- **Better Loom Info**: Enhances Loom video transcripts with AI-generated summaries and chapter markers
- **Upwork Contract Info**: Assists in drafting standardized contract titles and descriptions
- **Client Onboarding**: Helps capture and generate core content for initial client engagementsâ€”like summarizing transcripts, creating a client profile, and drafting a project plan.
- **Meeting Action Items**: Converts meeting transcripts into actionable insights and summaries
- **Slack Bot Messenger**: Sends formatted messages to Slack channels with markdown support and preview functionality
- **Slack Conversation Viewer**: Retrieves and displays Slack channel conversations with date filtering and markdown export capabilities
- **Humanize LLM Response**: Converts fancy typography marks in LLM responses to plain ASCII characters for better compatibility
