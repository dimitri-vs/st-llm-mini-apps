## üö® Delete this top section after cloning üö®

To get started with this template, follow all the steps in the collapsible section below.

‚ö†Ô∏è After cloning, remove this entire section from your README.md file once you've cloned the repository and are ready to proceed with your project.

1. Clone the repository with a different name:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Elevate-Code/streamlit-projectstarter.git {st-your-project-name}
   ```

2. Change into the cloned repository's directory:
   ```
   cd streamlit-new-project
   ```
   
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Remove the remote connection to the original repository:
   ```
   git remote remove origin
   ```

   This step decouples `streamlit-new-project` from `streamlit-projectstarter` by removing the remote connection to the original repository.

4. Make the desired changes to get your project to its initial stage:

   - Edit the `requirements.txt` file to match the initial dependencies you need for your project.
   - Check out the [streamlit_tips.md](streamlit_tips.md) file for how to use the debugger with VS Code or PyCharm and other tips.
   - Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
   - Run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - To check for newer packages than what is locked in `requirements.txt`, run `pip list --outdated`
   - Run `python start_project.py` to create template .env files, then delete this script file as it is no longer needed.

5. Clear the git history and create a new initial commit:
   ```
   git checkout --orphan latest_branch
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -D master
   git branch -m master
   ```
   This sequence of commands creates a new branch without any history, adds all the files, creates a new initial commit, deletes the old master branch, and renames the new branch (latest_branch) to 'master'.

6. Create a new private repository on your personal GitHub account. You can do this by visiting https://github.com/new and filling in the repository details. Make sure to set the visibility to "Private".

   (Optional) If you want to publish the repository under an organization account, create the new private repository on the organization's page instead.
   
   You can create the repository by visiting `https://github.com/organizations/{your-org-name}/repositories/new`.

8. Set the remote URL of your local repository to point to the new private repository:
   ```
   git remote add origin https://github.com/{path-copied-from-new-repo}.git
   ```

9. Push your local changes to the new private repository:
   ```
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   üîÅ Refresh the GitHub page, and you should see the code from the template repository in your new private repository.

### (Optional) Basic Authentication with `auth.py`

`auth.py` is provided for basic username-password authentication for a limited number of users. It's modular and can be removed if not needed.

1. Add user credentials to `.env` file in the format: `username='password'`
2. Add this code to the top of `app.py` and all other pages requiring authentication:
   ```python
   from auth import check_password
   if not check_password():
      st.warning("üîí Please log in using the sidebar.")
      st.stop()
    ```

## Running & Developing the Project Locally

### .env file
Duplicate and rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` adding your own values.

### Initial Setup
Requires Python 3.8 or higher
- Create a virtual environment using `python -m venv venv`
- Always run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
- Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the server

### Ongoing Development
- Run `venv\Scripts\activate` to activate the virtual environment
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Always activate the virtual environment before running any commands
- Run `streamlit run app.py` to start the server
- To check for package updates, run `pip list --outdated`
- To add new packages, first add it to `requirements.txt` then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Deploying to Railway.app
- Dashboard > New Project > Deploy from GitHub repo
- If you get a "Invalid service name" error create a blank service and then link the repo under Settings > Source Repo
- Select Add variables, under **Variables**:
    - Add `PORT` with value `8501`
    - Add other environment variables from `.env` file
- Click `x` to close open service, click Settings and update project name from auto-generated one, use repo name
- Click on the service (if you see Failed deployment, dont worry about it yet) under **Settings**:
    - At the top click üìù to change service name to "streamlit-app" or similar
    - Networking > Public Networking, click `Generate Domain`, port 8502, this will be the public URL, change if needed
    - Deploy > Custom Start Command, enter `streamlit run app.py`
- You should see a large banned that says "Apply 2 changes", click Deploy, takes about 5 minutes
- You should now be able to view the app at the public URL
- For debugging deployment issues, in the service, under **Deployments**:
    - Click on the latest deployment > `View Logs`
    - Check `Build Logs` and `Deploy Logs` for errors
